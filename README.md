# Merge Conflict Resolution - Case Study

## Note
The original repository (devops-intellipaat/merge-conflict) did not contain 
feature1 and feature2 branches as mentioned in the assignment. Therefore, I 
created the scenario myself to demonstrate merge conflict resolution skills.

## What I Did
1. Created feature1 branch with user authentication feature
2. Created feature2 branch with database integration feature
3. Added security patch to master branch
4. Resolved conflicts when merging master into feature branches
5. Resolved conflicts when merging features into master
